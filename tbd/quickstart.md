# Quick Start

Quick start:
Plug the device with USB-C connector in the back (next to the audio jacks) to get power.
After doing that press Reset (looking from the right - the rightmost button) - to trigger the TBD to boot. Currenly there is still a little issue so it isn't booting right after powering.
Connect to the WEBUI by joining the WIFI "ctag-tbd" and going to "http://ctag-tbd.local/"
One example for the various plugins is the "DRUMRACK". You can trigger the different tracks with Notes C1 and following on MIDI Channel 10.
