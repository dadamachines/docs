# Meet TBD DSP Toolkit  
### The Open Platform for Sonic Creation — Now in Three Formats
**Now Desktop & Standalone.**

---

## What is the TBD DSP Toolkit?

The **TBD DSP Toolkit** is an open, hackable, and deeply flexible audio platform—designed to empower both musicians and developers.

Built on the proven **CTAG TBD architecture**, previously available in Eurorack and AE Modular formats, TBD now breaks out of the rack and into your studio, desktop, or creative space.

Whether you want to develop your own DSP plugins, prototype ideas, or simply explore a massive palette of sound generators and effects, TBD is your new creative playground.

### The “Eierlegende Wollmilchsau”:  
_(That’s German for “Swiss Army Knife”!)_  
Over 50 professional-grade audio engines & effects, open architecture, and a cloud compiler—all in a standalone box.
