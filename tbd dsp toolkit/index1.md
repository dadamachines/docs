![TBD Prototype](images/dada-tbd-prototype_002.jpeg)

The **dadamachines ‚Äì TBD DSP toolkit** is a compact, open-source audio platform for creating custom instruments and effects.

Built on the ESP32 architecture, TBD offers a powerful environment for real-time DSP, interfacing, and performance.

Inspired by platforms like [axoloti](https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti), [monome norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/), [Electrosmith daisy](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed) and [Bela](https://bela.io/) , TBD brings a playful and extensible toolkit to both musicians and developers. With more than 50 high-quality audio generators and effects, and a plugin system that‚Äôs easy to build upon, TBD is part instrument, part playground, part learning space.

The TBD DSP toolkit is a collaboration between [dadamachines](https://dadamachines.com) and [CTAG](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel), the Creative Technologies Working Group at University of Applied Science Kiel (FH Kiel), Germany.

## what it is

- A powerful, open-source DSP toolkit.
- An extensible embedded audio platform for real-time sound generation and processing.
- A portable learning and experimentation tool for embedded DSP.
- A hardware module that runs dozens of plugin-based instruments and effects.
- A starting point for your own DSP instruments.

## features

- Over 50 built-in effects, synths, and utilities.
- Plugin architecture for easy extension in C++.
- Web-based configuration UI (via WiFi) and REST-API support.
- Sample ROM playback and user-defined wavetables.
- Cross-platform simulator for plugin development.
- Cloud compiler to build your own firmware sets.

## plugin architecture & firmware development

TBD firmware is written in **C++** and designed to be easily extensible. Creating your own plugins is straightforward:

- **Start with a template** like the `SimpleVCA` plugin.
- **Inherit from** the `ctagSoundProcessor.hpp` base class.
- **Implement the `Process(const ProcessData&)`** method ‚Äî this is your plugin's audio/CV processing loop (similar to VST-style processing).
- **Define plugin parameters** in a dedicated JSON file. This file is used for automatic UI generation in the TBD web interface.

Plugins have access to:
- Audio input/output buffers  
- Control voltages  
- Triggers and gate signals  
All wrapped in the `ProcessData` structure.

The firmware is built using the **Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF)** and can be compiled for both the simulator and real hardware.

**Deployment options:**
- Flash firmware via micro-USB  
- Or update directly through the TBD web UI using over-the-air (OTA) updates  

No special tools or debug adapters required.

## simulator

To streamline plugin development, TBD includes a **cross-platform simulator** that runs on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

The simulator uses **RtAudio** as its audio engine and supports:

- Real-time audio input/output using your system‚Äôs sound card  
- Testing plugins with pre-recorded WAV files  
- Debugging your plugin‚Äôs logic before flashing it to hardware

This tool dramatically reduces iteration time and makes plugin development faster and easier.

More details and setup instructions are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd).
